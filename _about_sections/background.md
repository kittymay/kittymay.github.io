  - I've been facilitating learning about sex, sexuality and relationships since 2004, initially as a volunteer in sexuality and gender awareness programmes and, from 2008, as a professional youth worker. With training and experience, I established expertise in sex and relationships education, and began training professionals on how (and why) to talk with youth about sex.
  - I realised that it's not just young people who want information, or value the opportunity to explore ideas and feelings, about sexuality. So, I developed my practice further and started creating workshops and sessions for adults. Now based in Berlin, I have been a freelance sex educator, facilitator and trainer, for people of all ages, since 2012.
  - As well as a BA (hons) (University of Leeds, UK) and an MA (McGill University, Canada) in English Literature, I hold a Diploma in Informal Education (YMCA George Williams College, UK) and a Postgraduate Certificate in Person-Centered Counseling Skills (University of East Anglia, UK). I have professional experience in both the non-profit and public sector, and have worked in Canada, the UK, South Africa and Germany. Please get in touch if you would like to see my full C.V.
