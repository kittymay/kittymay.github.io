				<h4>Girls Just Wanna... a toy worksop for women who play with women</h4>

				<p>Just wanna have fun? Then this workshop is for you! We’ll look at a range of options for enhancing your play, including vibrators, strap-ons and butt toys. After covering some basics about materials and design, we’ll move on to What People Actually Do with the toys on offer.</p>
				<p>Find out how toys can add a little something (or a big something!) extra to your existing play, or lead you into totally new adventures. The workshop will cover ways to talk to your lover/s about using toys, sharing & safer sex, and top tips for handling harnesses. We’ll also touch on stereotypes about using toys… and bust open the myth of penis-envy!</p>

				<p>All particpants will receive a 5€ gift voucher for use on their next toy purchase.</p>

				<h4>Come As You Are: Demystifying Orgasm</h4>

				<p>Is the “Big O” a big mystery? Orgasms can be elusive for many people, especially those of us who have been socialised as female. Whether you’ve never had one, aren’t sure if you have, or would like to feel more in tune with when and how they happen, this workshop is for anyone who wants to better understand their own orgasmic capacity.</p>
				<p>We’ll cover important anatomy, including the clitoris and G-spot, learn about how pleasure builds in the mind and body, identify factors that can inhibit orgasm, and share ideas about how to enhance our sexual sensation, whether playing alone or with others.</p>

				<p>Please note: the anatomical portion of the workshop will be on the vulva, and we will consider the ways in which identifying as/being socialised as female can influence our relationships with our bodies,desire, and satisfaction. The workshop is open to anyone who *personally* relates to any of these topics and is interested in exploring *their own* orgasm.
