    <h3>(Re)Claiming Sexuality</h3>
    <p></p>
    
    <p></p>
    <div class="event-section">
      <p><em>“This workshop is life-changing” - participant feedback, 2016</em></p>

<p>(Re)Claiming Sexuality is a supportive, sex-positive and affirming workshop series that can help you to gain insight, develop your sense of sexual agency and improve sexual communication.</p>

<p>Focussing each week on a different area of experience – including pleasure, fantasy, values, and relationships – you will get to know your sexuality more fully and have the chance to embrace your authentic sexual self.</p>

<p>Many of us are unsure of what we really desire, feel constrained by gender expectations and inherited values, or are healing from sexual trauma. Whether affected by these issues or simply curious to learn more, you are invited to nurture and (re)claim your sexuality!</p>

<p>Workshop format:</p>

<p>Each session includes short exercises designed to spark personal reflection, followed by longer periods of facilitated discussion. There is no obligation to disclose more than is comfortable, and, in addition to group exchange, there will be time for solo reflection. Some exercises work with the body but are not designed to be sexual in nature.</p>

    <h3>Self-Compassion: What, Why & How</h3>
    <p></p>
    
    <p></p>
    <div class="event-section">
      <p>“Compassion is the master emotion of positive change” - Jack Morin</p>

<p>In this class, I’ll draw on my experience both as a therapist and a meditation practitioner as we explore what self-compassion is, why it benefits both ourselves and others, and how to cultivate it.</p>

<p>We’ll look at the ways in which practicing meditation can help to build self-compassion and how, in turn, self-compassion supports a meditation practice.</p>

<p>I’ll introduce some tools for practice, and there will be space for participants who feel comfortable to exhange experiences and share their self-compassion strategies.</p>

<p>No meditation experience necessary!</p>

    <h3>Demystifying Orgasm</h3>
    <p></p>
    
    <p></p>
    <div class="event-section">
      <p>Is the “Big O” a big mystery? Orgasms can be elusive for many people, especially women and others assigned female at birth. Whether you’ve never had one, aren’t sure if you have, or would like to feel more in tune with when and how they happen, this workshop is for anyone who wants to better understand their own orgasmic capacity.</p>

<p>We’ll cover important anatomy, including the clitoris and G-spot, learn about how pleasure builds in the mind and body, identify factors that can inhibit orgasm, and share ideas about how to enhance our sexual sensation, whether playing alone or with others. You’ll walk away with lots of tips to help you get better acquainted with your body, your desires – and your orgasms.</p>

<p>Please note: the anatomical portion of the workshop will be on the vulva and vagina, and we will consider the ways in which identifying as or being socialised as female can influence our relationships with our bodies, desire, and satisfaction. The workshop is open to anyone who personally relates to any of these topics and is interested in exploring their own orgasm.</p>
